# ABOUT THIS PROJECT
Actually, it's not a case of document fraud, but in some way, this is some kind of dream, a dream to create a masterful copy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' personal document. Honestly, I'm curious whether it's possible to trick the system with this document. So, you can try ;)
## HOW TO USE
Open this URL on your device [Reserv-Plus](https://yaoleksa.github.io/reserv-plus/). Firstly app asks your full name (Last name, first name, middle name `your father name with -ich ending`) and date of your birthday. After that you have to see almost the same page as Ukranian's military document application [Reserv-plus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ua.gov.reserveplus&hl=uk&pli=1). Application asks your personal data each time when you visit this [web-site](https://yaoleksa.github.io/reserv-plus/)
